# Getting started

This document will help you to get started with the [TradeTracker app](https://beta.tradetracker.app), and start journaling your trades.
Because we are currently still in a closed beta program, you will have to apply to this first.

## Gaining access to our closed beta program

To gain access to [TradeTracker](https://beta.tradetracker.app), first apply for our closed beta program [on our website](https://tradetracker.app).
Once you have received your account, you can login at [https://beta.tradetracker.app/login](https://beta.tradetracker.app/login).

## First steps to start journaling

Once you have logged into the app, follow these steps to set-up your journal. You can click on these links, and they will guide you to the app.

  * Go to `Portfolios` and [create a new portfolio](https://beta.tradetracker.app/portfolios#new) by clicking the `+` icon.
  * Go to `Transactions` and [add your first transaction](https://beta.tradetracker.app/transactions#new) by clicking the `+` icon. Your first transaction should be a deposit with your actual exchange balance.
  * [Open the calculator](https://beta.tradetracker.app#open-calculator) in the top right corner, or click on the `+` in the top right corner, to [enter your first trade](https://beta.tradetracker.app/new-trade).
  
## Connect to your favorite exchange API (optional)

To make trading easier, you can add your favorite exchange API. To do this, go to [account management](/account-management) (click on your name in the rop right corner), and [scroll down to API keys](https://beta.tradetracker.app/account#api-keys).
There are two different types of API keys that you can add, read-only, and read-write.

### Read-only 

If you add a read-only API key, your last 3 executed orders will be displayed in the [trade set up page](https://beta.tradetracker.app/new-trade), and can be added to the trade in a single click.

The ability to synchronize your exchange orders with your portfolio is still in development, and will be added later!

### Read-write

If you add a read-write key, you can also submit orders to your exchange by using the [calculator](/calculator). This should help prevent slippage between calculating your trade, and executing it manually on the exchange. 

Due to security reasons, you are required to [set up 2-factor authentication](https://beta.tradetracker.app/account#two-factor-authentication) first before you can add a read-write API key.
